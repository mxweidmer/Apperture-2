# Apperture

A photography scouting app.  A user can enter information about a location relating to pictures they took. Including time of year, time of day, issues they came across, how busy the place was, etc. A user will have a profile where they can link to their portfolio, turning the platform somewhat into a publicity building tool. Similar to yelp for photography.

User sign-in data is stored in a MySQL database, so that users can sign in when they revisit the app using the email and password they gave when they sign up on their first visit.
